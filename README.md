# Interactive Bike Sales Dashboard & Customer Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I transformed a raw dataset of 1,000 bike buyer records into a fully interactive business intelligence dashboard using only Microsoft Excel. The goal was to perform a deep-dive analysis to identify the key characteristics of a typical bike buyer and present the findings in a dynamic, easy-to-use format for stakeholders.

The entire workflow, from data cleaning and feature engineering to the final dashboard, is contained within the provided Excel file.

## Key Features & Analysis

* **Interactive Dashboard:** I designed and built a dynamic dashboard from scratch. It features KPI cards for at-a-glance metrics and interactive slicers that allow users to filter the data by key demographics like region, age, income, and occupation, revealing specific trends instantly.

* **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Before analysis, I performed essential data cleaning to ensure accuracy. I then engineered new features to enhance the dataset, such as creating logical 'Age Brackets' from the 'Age' column to enable more effective demographic segmentation.

* **Customer Segmentation Model:** A core part of this project was engineering a 'Purchase Probability Score' and a customer segmentation model. This model classifies customers into groups like 'Standard', 'High Potential', and 'Premium', allowing for the prioritization of high-value buyers and targeted marketing strategies.

* **In-Depth Demographic Analysis:** The dashboard's pivot tables and charts allow for dynamic drill-downs into purchasing patterns across different segments. This makes it easy to answer critical business questions, such as "How does commute distance affect the likelihood of purchase?" or "Which occupations have the highest purchase rate?".

## Technologies Used

* **Primary Tool:** Microsoft Excel (Formulas, Pivot Tables, Slicers, Dashboarding)
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub
